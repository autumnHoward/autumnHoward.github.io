    <h1 class="page-title">My Branding Philosophy</h1>
    <p class="para">Transitioning from illustration to graphic design was tricky for me. Illustration is all about story telling, and emphasizes detail and realism. Visual communication and graphic design, on the other hand, focus more on symbolism and simplicity. In branding, I've found the perfect marriage of these two goals; telling a brand story through recognizable visual communication. </p>

            <img class="responsive" src="images-branding/cake-logo2.png" alt="Cakes by Autumn logo"/></div>
            <div class="brand-col"><p>Cakes by Autumn is a brand I developed for my small cake and pastry business. This brand is devoted to creating quality baked goods for weddings, parties, and other small events. Cakes by Autumn is all about creating desserts that look too good to eat– but taste even more delicious than they look. For food brands in particular, you want the photography to convey how delicious the food is. 
            <br>My goal for the design work for this brand is that it delivers a light and casual– yet luxurious and indulgent– feel.
            <br>This brand is active across social media channels including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/autumnspastries/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/cakesbyautumn/pins/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>. Running these channels involves creating new and engaging branded content regularly, such as photography and the occasional tutorial video.  
            <br> This brand will uphold my personal mission statement regarding social media: “To Share Goodness.” Each image will feature a story about the newly wedded couple, or the birthday boy, or the newborn baby girl; the goal is to share stories about people celebrating happy memories with cake.</p></div>

        <div class="brand-col"><p>Reworking the branding for this carniceria was a very fun project. I love being able to tie in cultural elements that make a brand unique. As this project was for a traditional carniceria, I used bright colors and Mexican motifs to create the pig logo and business card design for this meat shop.</p></div>
