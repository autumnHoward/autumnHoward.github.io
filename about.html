        <div>
            <p class="leftie"> I would classify myself a lover of excellent design, delicious food, and captivating books. Iâ€™m a wife, mother, illustrator, cake decorator, web designer, developer, and student. One could say I wear a lot of hats, and one would be right. I love the challenges and intricacies that come from exploring creative solutions to difficult problems. Whether that solution is expressed in code or in frosting, I believe that learning and solid communication are foundational to getting it right.</p>

            <h2>Background and Education</h2>
            <p class="leftie">I'm proud to hail from sunny El Paso, Texas. Growing up in such a culturally-rich community marked me with a flavor of diversity and color in life. I left home to study  Visual Arts with an emphasis in Illustration at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I had an amazing time there, but I paused my schooling to serve a full-time mission among the spanish-speaking population in Northern Illinois. My mission was a tremendous experience, and afterwards things fell into place when I married my childhood friend from Texas. I also felt the need to change my educational focus in favor of something more technical. After learning C++ and that softeare engineering isn't the job for me, I found my passion right in the middle of art and coding. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Web Design and Development, and love every minute of it.
