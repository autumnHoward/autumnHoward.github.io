            <h2>Sally's Side</h2>
            <p>Growing up, my father always used to quote C.S.Lewis:</p>
            <blockquote>“You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.”</blockquote>
            <p>I suppose I took those words to heart, because tea became a passion of mine (and books of course, but that's for another day!) </p>
            <p>Joe and I set out to create signature blends that would reflect our vision, and we are proud to share our love of tea with our new home in Salt Lake City.</p>

            <h2>Joe's Side</h2>
            <p>Sweet Leaf started for me with a cup of tea in a stranger's home in Japan. The artistry and tradition that surrounded a simple cup of tea amazed me, and I was instantly hooked on the authenticity of the experience.</p>
            <p>Most Americans don't have a huge sense of tradition when it comes to tea ceremonies, but I was determined to introduce some of the flavors and sights home with me. I returned to America after travelling abroad with a notebook filled with notes and ideas for the teas I wanted to blend. That's when I met Sally, and the Sweet Leaf name was born.</p>
